           <h2>My Mother's Challah Recipe</h2> 
        </header>
        

        <section class="description"> 
            <p> This is my mother's challah bread recipe. Challah is a Jewish celebratory bread, traditionally served at Shabbat meals.</p>
            <p>I committed myself to learning it when I was stuck at home during the COVID-19 quarantine. Now, I make it once a week on Fridays to celebrate the weekly Sabbath with my friends.</p>
            <p>Though typically served as part of this weekly holiday, Challah is delicious any day, any time. It is slightly sweet, perfectly fluffy, and perfect for sandwhiches, toast, or simply on it's own.</p>
            <img src="images/Challah.jpg" alt="challah">
            <p>This is the basic dough recipe, but you can also stuff the dough with different fillings and top it with seasonings to try new flavors. Some stuffing examples are pesto, truffle, cheese, peanut butter and jelly, and even nutella. Top your challah with sesame seeds, Everything But the Bagel seasoning, Za'atar, or even just some flaky sea salt for the perfect salty-sweet bites.</p>

            <p><b>Note:</b> <em>This recipe takes several hours for rising time. Start making your dough in the morning to be able to serve it the same night. You can also bake ahead and store in the freezer, simply reheating in the oven when you are ready to enjoy.</em> </p>

            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by combing yeast, sugar, and warm water in a bowl and let it sit for 5-10 minutes (this is to let the yeast activate; you'll know it's ready and working when it's bubbling). PIC </li>
                <li>To the same bowl, add in your egg yolks, egg, sugar, oil, honey, and salt. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Once this liquid mixture is combined, add in your flour, incorporating it to the liquid mixture as you add each cup (this will help you with incorporating: it's hard to mix a lot of flour into the liquid ingredients at once.) </li>
                <li>Once you start to feel a dough form (will be a bit clumpy), you can go in with your hands and start kneading in the bowl or on a flat surface. PIC </li>
                <li>Continue kneading well (using palms) for 5-10 minutes. Add flour to hands and counter if the dough is sticking.</li>
                <li>Let your dough sit in the bowl covered by a towel for <b>2 hours</b>.</li>
                <li>After 2 hours, the dough should have risen a bit. Punch it down 3-4 times and cover again.</li>
                <li>After <b>1 hour</b>, knead your dough for another 2 minutes to get it soft again and then cut in half.</li>
                <li>With each half, divide dough into 3 pieces. Roll these out into long logs and braid. PIC</li>
                <li>Lay your two braids on a baking sheet with parchment paper and cover with towel again. Let them sit for another <b>1 hour</b>. <em>(Now would also be a good time to preheat your oven to 350 degrees)</em> </li>
                <li>Combine the last egg with about a teaspoon of water and mix well to make egg wash. Paint this over the challahs before putting them in the oven. (Add any toppings/seasonings over the egg wash!)</li>
                <li>Bake in oven for <b>25-30 minutes</b>, turning the pan halfway through for an even bake. The bottoms of the challahs should be a golden brown when they are ready.</li>
                <li>Let cool for <b>5-10 minutes</b>, and then enjoy warm!</li>
                <p>Again, If you are not ready to enjoy your challahs immediately, store them in the freezer (after cooling) and heat them up in the oven to defrost and enjoy another day! They'll keep in the freezer for about 3 months.</p>
              </ol>
