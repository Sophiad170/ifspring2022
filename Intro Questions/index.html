            <p>2. I think I want to go into some form of media/marketing and I feel like having some background in this stuff will be an asset. I don't know anything about it (have never written html until now), but so excited to learn!</p>
            <p>3. Nope!</p>
            <p>4. How to make my own website and just make things look nice digitally. I would also love to just develop an eye for nice design. </p>
            <p>5. I think it'll be very different! More options to consider - you can do anything basically! Designing on paper is a bit more limiting in that you can only do what your hand is capable of.</p>
            <p>6. This <a href="https://beccapr.com"> PR firm's</a> website is aesthetically pleasing, simple, easy to navigate, and totally captures their vibe/persona as a company.</p>
            <p>7. <a href="https://www.theinfatuation.com/products"> The Infatuation's</a> website effectively communicates what their site offers. As a company that offers a lot of different things, the ability to filter, search, and navigate the website at the top is super helpful.</p> 
            <p> 8. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix's</a> works very well. It is straightforward, accessible, and reliable.</p>
