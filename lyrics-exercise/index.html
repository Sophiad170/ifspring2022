<p>Hey kids, shake it loose together</p>
<p>The spotlight's hitting something</p>
<p>That's been known to change the weather</p>
<p>We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around</p>
<p>You're gonna hear electric music</p>
<p>Solid walls of sound</p>
<br>
<p class="chorus"> Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?</p>
<p class="chorus">Ooh, but they're so spaced out, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets</p>
<p class="chorus">Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful</p>
<p class="chorus">Oh Bennie she's really keen</p>
<p class="chorus">She's got electric boots, a mohair suit</p>
<p class="chorus">You know I read it in a magazine, ohh-oh</p>
<p class="bennie">B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets</p>
<br>
<p>Hey kids, plug into the faithless</p>
<p>Maybe they're blinded</p>
<p>But Bennie makes them ageless</p>
<p>We shall survive, let us take ourselves along</p>
<p>Where we fight our parents out in the streets</p>
<p>To find who's right and who's wrong</p>
